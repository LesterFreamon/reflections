What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates an invsisble .git directory that will store the history of the files.  It creates a master branch where the files are located.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area keeps the info of files that are intended to be committed, but alows to still make changes before the commit takes place.
