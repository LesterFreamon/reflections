When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I work on more than one computer or if more than one person is working on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because you may make changes that do not coincide with the repsoitory on the remote and vice versa
